# gonfig

A small and simple package I wrote for reading/writing JSON encoded configuration files.

The package exists primarily for others to learn Go, but it may be useful in projects.

While using this package is (hopefully) dead simple, I recommend that you seek out more full-featured packages, such as [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper).
